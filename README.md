#Hike Through
## Background
The act of walking and exploration is a central theme to _Hike Through_. Through the act of earning "travel currency" by actual walking in the real world, I intend to make the exploration od the game world analogous to the exploration of the real world.

The game itself is an homage to [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) games and a way for people both interested in role-playing games and exploring the physical world to connect and share an experience. The distance you cover by walking is logged and tracked over the history of gameplay and can be see on a users profile as a credential of their expertise.

The user starts each game session with only one life (Rogue-like) and can continue to play and explore one continuously generated map up until death, at which point statistics are given for the most recent game and the option to begin a new game with the same avatar.

The maps may or may end up being randomly generated depending on the scope of this project and available time to complete.
